# quizApp

## What is it?

In it's simplest form - it is a vanilla JS mini quiz app.
<br>
It only has 5 questions and all of which are obsurdly easy to answer (except for the one about my age).

## How do I use it?

You can fork and/or clone this repo and then bring it down locally onto your machine. Once you have the project you can open it with your preferred IDE.
<br>
_There are no dependencies to install as it is vanilla JS and doesn't use any packages_
<br>
You can then run this by using an extension called [Live-Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (if using vscode).

## What can I do with it?

It's a very crude app so I wouldn't expect much from it - however it is a good starting foundation for creating something more powerful. You could explore the code that is currently there and tweak it/add to it to make it the way you want it!
